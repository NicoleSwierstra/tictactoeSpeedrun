# tictactoeSpeedrun

Origionally meant to be tictactoe created in under an hour (a goal that was met but it was unfortunately cli), this eventually bloomed into a minigame collection.

This includes:
* Tetris - a somewhat barebones version but it has everything you need and NES timings/rotation
* Tic Tac Toe - the reason for this project existing.
* Hexes - a game of my own invention. It sucks
* Minesweeper - I'm writing this readme far after i've programmed the app but i'm p sure its slightly broken on the first move
